                        <h4>Nadal to miss Wimbledon to focus on Olympics</h4>
                        <p>Two-time champion Rafael Nadal will not play at Wimbledon this year in order to focus on the Olympics in Paris.</p>
                        <img src="images/nadal.jpg" alt="Sport">
                        
                        <p>The 38-year-old Spaniard said he will compete in a clay-court event in Bastad, Sweden, as preparation for the Olympic tennis tournament which begins on 27 July.</p>
                        <p>Wimbledon, where Nadal won in 2008 and 2010, starts on 1 July.</p>
                        <p>Nadal, a 22-time Grand Slam champion, said he was "saddened" to be missing the "great atmosphere" of Wimbledon, which "will always be in my heart".</p>
                        <p>Following his first-round exit at the French Open last month, Nadal said returning to the clay at Roland Garros at the Olympics was now his main target.</p>
                        <p>"With this goal, we believe that the best for my body is not to change surface and keep playing on clay until then," he said.</p>
                        <p>Nadal, who is ranked 264th in the world, will play doubles with Carlos Alcaraz at the Olympics.</p>
                        <p>Nadal has previously said that he expected to retire later this year, but said before the French Open that he could not say "100%" if that would be the last time he played in the tournament.</p>
